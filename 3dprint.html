                    <br> This is my 1st assignment with the 3D printer where I am required to design a personal
                    handphone stand. I took inspiration from one of my favourite animated shows where I spoted a book
                    stand that was designed with a butterfly silhouette.
                    I thought it would be gorgeous to incorporate it as the phone rest for the handphone stand.

                <p>
                    <br> The handphone stand consist of 2 seperate parts.
                <ol>
                    <li> <u>Body</u> <i>(Fig. D)</i> : Butterfly silhouette design holding the phone.
                        <br>
                    <li> <u>Stem</u> <i>(Fig. E)</i> : Structure supporting the weight of the entire design.</li>
                    <br><br>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p> As for the 3D modelling, I used Autodesk's Fushion360 to ideate. After messing around with the
                    features,
                    i came up with the overall design. Firstly, I took a sketch of a butterfly image as a canvas to
                    trace
                    out in Fushion360 before extruding it out by about 4mm, giving the overall <u>Body</u> a thick and
                    firm
                    shape. Anything lesser than 4mm will make the design feel too fragile and anything more would be too
                    bulky
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, I have to assess the angle of tilt for the handphone to rest on the <u>Body</u> as well as the
                    length of the platform that holds the phone. Then I move on to design the <u>Stem</u> which must be
                    rugged and firm to prevent the structure from collapsing with the weight of the phone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Fig. A and B, I added fillet and chamfer details to make the design more personalised rather than
                    leaving it with sharp corners. Sharp corners and boxy corners will make my handphone stand look
                    amateurish/boring.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, both the <u>Body</u> and <u>Stem</u> eventually came together with a mounting system.
                    In Fig. C, the mounting was designed in a way that allows it to take the weight of the entire
                    structure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <br> Although the handphone stand was completed, there was some challenges faced along the way.
                    In Fig. F and G, the butterfly feelers on top were too fragile and an attempt to remove the support
                    broke it off the entire body. Also, the hole that was meant to fit in the phone's charging
                    cable
                    was too small and the overall structure was too low/short. These mistakes required time to
                    correct before time is needed for reprinting to take place.
                    Through this, I have learnt that I should do up proper calculations before printing out my designs
                    :)!
