                    Cat.IO is a prototyped multi-function alarm clock with built-in night lights.<br>
                    <br> In this project, I wanted to create something practical and functional that I would find useful
                    in my daily life.
                    Thus, I decided on the idea of a desk alarm clock which can double as a night light, being someone
                    that is afraid of the dark. As for the exterior casing of the clock, i took inspiration from the
                    features of one of my favourite animals, cats.
                    With this, Cat.IO was created.

                    <li>A pair of speakers that could also play music/audio other then sounding the alarm.
                    <li>3D printed cat ears that could rotates up to 180° (90° on each sides).
                    <li>Cut outs that would be replaced by acrylic pieces to allow for light to pass through.</li>

                    The cat ears located at the top of the board, have curved features which were not achievable via

                    of the plywood. Therefore, I decided to achieve the curve look of the cats ears thru 3D printing

                    The 2nd prototype included the extra holes that were missed out on in the first prototype and a few
                    added mm's
                    to the dimentions of the ear models. However this led to the ear models being too big to fit on the

                    I chose to use 3mm plywood for the body of the alarm clock due to its opaque properties and to
                    obtain a more natural look.
                    To make the body look more appealing, I added engravings and cuts to the sides of the box. <br> <br>

                    Some problems faced was the unexpected extra thickness of the plywood by 0.5mm. This caused some
                    overfitting of the laser cut pieces.
                    The tiny size of the stars also caused some problems with the laser cut. To overcome this problem,
                    laser cut had to be done a maximum of 3 times to ensure the board was cut through.

                        Moving on to the assembling of the clock electronics, it was first done on a long breadboard.
                        But, the long breadboard took up too much space in the clock therefore I decided to try
                        minising the space by transferring everyth on a veroboard (stripboard) to minimise the space
                        usage.

                        Throughout the process of assembling the wiring of the clock, I had the opportunity of trying
                        out soldering.
                        However, since i do not have experience with soldering beforehand, i faced many difficulties of
                        having weak soldering/dry joins connections which resulted in the soldered wires falling out of
                        place repeatedly. This process thus took up quite a fair bit of time

                        However after finishing the soldering I found out that I was not suppose to directly solder the
                        components onto the veroboard incase certain components did not work or get damaged along the
                        way.
                        Soldering them on directly would result in more trouble if the stated events were to happen.
                        Therefore I went back to using the breadboard, utilising a smaller breadboard instead of the big
                        one I used at first.

                        Improvements that can be implemented on this section is on the management of the wires.
                        As can be seen from the pictures above, the wires are placed messily in the box. As for wiring,
                        I had to figure out which cable to connect to each output. Therefore, some researching was done.
