                    <br> In this assignment, I was tasked to ideate and create an accessory box that fit the task
                    requirements.
                    I wanted to personalise the accessory box to represent myself and was inspired by the piano, one of
                    my few hobbies.

                <p>
                    <br> Firstly, I learnt that there are different lasercutting materials. Hence, I chose plywood with
                    a 3mm thickness as
                    my material of choice. To better prepare myself for lasercutting, I went to Art Friend to purchase 2
                    sheets of
                    24in x 32in, 3mm plywood. The conversion from imperial to metric is 609.6mm x 812.8mm. I carefully
                    chose the board
                    that are not naturally warped to prevent problems during the cutting. In Fig, A shows the plywood
                    section in the
                    store and Fig. B is the board dimensions.

                        <i> Storage compartments
                        </i>

                <p>
                    <br> The accessory box is separated into 3 different compartments with corresponding sizes. The main
                    compartment has the biggest area to put things such as necklaces, followed by a side compartment to
                    keep rings or finger accessories, and then finally, 3 drawers for ear rings and other remaining
                    small body
                    accessories. The space of the box is modelled after inspiration from ma grand piano. It sort of
                    represents
                    my hobby of playing the piano and also the art of the grand piano itself is sleek and elegant.
                    Therefore, I attempt to put these design elements together.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The accessory box was actually a challenging one as the piano design has curved edges. The piano
                    design would have looked
                    another level better if there were living hinges to facilitate the bend corners but however, I had
                    some difficulty designing
                    it. Hence, the final design has some wasted space at the back.

                    <br> The final laser cut took about slightly less than 4 minutes to cut.

                <p>
                    Just like some the 3D prints assignment, I faced challenges trying to come up with the accessories
                    box.
                    Some of the major issues I found was:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Living hinges would be a better alternative to the awkward bends.
                        <br>
                    <li> The projected size of my accessory box after the cut was slightly smaller.
                        <br>
                    <li> The inital design was not engraved/engrave with a setting that was too light.
                        <br>
                    <li> The drawer measurements has too tight of a tolerance. (see Fig. C)
                    </li>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    However, after recitifying the mesurements, I eventually came out with the final model that was
                    stable, firm and of course, beautiful for my jewelries.
